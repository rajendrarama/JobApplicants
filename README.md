# JobApplicants
This is a simple Web application providing a list of job applicants and the details of each.

The solution when downloaded can be run straightaway to see the application up and running.

I have created an instance of the concrete class in the constructor. However this can be avoided by implementing Dependancy Injection 
through Ninject/Unity.
